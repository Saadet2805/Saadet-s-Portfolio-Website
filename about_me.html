                <h2>Studies and Areas of Interest</h2>
                <p>Hi! I am Saadet. A third year student studying Software Engineering at Epoka University. I will be graduating in the year of 2025. I liked coding ever since middle school. The first things that we learned were Scratch, coding in C++ and in high school we continued with Photoshop, HTML, javascript and MySQL. In university we started with programming in C and continued with object-oriented programming (C++, Java, Python). Along these programming courses we also have design and database courses. The area that I have the most interest in, however, is Web Technologies and Programming (both front and back end). I am willing to continue my Master studies in either these areas or in cyber security. In this website you can find many of the projects that I have made throughout my university years.</p>
                <h2>Personal Life and Skills</h2>
                <p>I was born in 2004 which makes me 20 years old (as of now). My parents are Turkish but I was born in Albania and I have dual citizenship. I can speak Turkish, Albanian and English very well and I am in the learning stage of German. I love both being active and being in my solitude. I have a great sense of empathy and can cooperate well in a group (both as a member and as a leader).</p>
                <p>The programming languages (and other IT skills) that I know include:</p>
